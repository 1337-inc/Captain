1$a$???$So, you must be having many questions. Would you like to ask anything?$$$$Who are you?$$2
2$$???$I am a higher dimensional being from the future, a descendant of the settlers of this planet. Our society is able to manipulate the flow of time to a certain extent, and as such we are obliged to save the universe from 'The Calamity'.$$$$So why exactly are you here?$$3
3$$???$I am here because this timeline leads to the destruction of the universe by 'the Calamity'. Our people has analyzed all possible futures, and found that this timeline was initiated because you died within the wormhole. Now that I have saved you, we should be able to create enough divergence to stop 'The Calamity'. Of course, too much divergence also causes the universe to collapse...$$$$I see.$a$
4$a$???$So, you must be having many questions. Would you like to ask anything?$$$$Why do I keep getting resurrected?$$5
5$$???$In the original timeline, you perished in the wormhole. By saving you, the timeline diverged and became a time loop, that resets every time you die.$$$$So what am I even supposed to do?$$6
6$$???$We need to create enough divergence so as to stop 'The Calamity' from ever existing. Something major, like somehow canceling the mission before it ever started, or killing everyone in the colony. Of course this comes at the risk of the timeline collapsing, but seeing as how the universe will end anyway, its worth a shot.$$$$...I see.$a$
7$a$???$So, you must be having many questions. Would you like to ask anything?$$$$What is divergence?$$8
8$$???$Divergence is basically how much the timeline changes due to the actions of a time traveller. Too much divergence ends up destroying the timeline, and the universe collapses (this is not an exact science.) This is what The Calamity is trying to do.$$$$So what is The Calamity?$$9
9$$???$The Calamity is a being in this current timeline who will create enough divergence to destroy the universe as we know it. His identity and motives are still unknown.$$$$I see.$a$
10$a$Professor Zylberstein$I am thinking of a word. Can you guess it?$$$$Sorry, no idea...$$11
11$$Professor Zylberstein$Oh... thats too bad. Anyways, the word is doughnut. Remember that.$$$$Okay...$a$
12$a$Professor Zylberstein$I am thinking of a word. Can you guess it?$$$$Doughnut?$$13
13$$Professor Zylberstein$YEZ! Zo you muzt be a time looper? All my work iz paying off...$$$$What do you mean by all 'your' work?$$14
14$$Professor Zylberstein$Well... yeah, I waz behind everything, from the engine failure within the wormhole, to the future evolution of mankind, all to achieve my ultimate goal...$$$$What?$$15
15$$Professor Zylberstein$I want to be the one who discovers time travel. For that I needed you out of the picture. Originally with you gone, my experiments would cause humanity to tranzend into exactly what I need. You being here means that future has already happened, and there muzt be a higher dimenzional being with you! $$$$Why do you need a higher dimensional being?$$16
16$$Professor Zylberstein$I need its mind, in order to complete my MK1 Time Machine, capable of zending a message to the pazt. If I zend thiz data to myzelf on earth, I could really make a proper time machine.$$$$Why should I help you?$$17
17$$Professor Zylberstein$Becauze... the univerze will probably end if you do not. The Calamity is zomething I have factored into my calculationz. The thing that zaved you, probabaly (unintentionally) became The Calamity .$$$$What do you mean??$$18
18$$Professor Zylberstein$By zaving you it opened up too many pozible futurez. If you make the wrong choice, the timeline will fracture, and the univerze will most likely, end.$$$$Fine. What should I do?$$19
19$$Professor Zylberstein$I have prepared for this eventuality. I prezume you alwayz ztart in the Leviathan? I have prepared a mind computer interface on board the ship. Quickly plug him into it, and send the data to me next time you die.$$$$Got it.$a$
