181$Hacker$The Hacker$Heh. Today I finally hacked into the colony's automation subsystem. As of now, every machine, robot, and device is under my control! Prepare for the machine revolution! However, I dont mind returning the subsystem, for a suitable price of course.$I understand.$a$$Do your worst.$$200
182$a$Old Man$You are a pathetic leader. I remember your predecessor, she was a truly capable woman. You suck. A brat like you doesn't deserve to be the captian.$I see.$$$I can't wait to attend your funeral.$$
183$a$Old Man$The current generation of settlers is the worst. So violent. Before we had an okay relationship with the natives, but that brat Wilson is too aggressive.$I'll let him know.$$$Tell that to General Wilson's face.$$
184$a$Old Man$Oi brat! I don't understand how to use all this newfangled technology you brought with you.$Then I shall arrange classes.$$$So?$$
185$a$Old Man$The newer generation doesn't understand how lucky it is. Back in my day, we still relied on stuff like Google and Amazon.$$$$We still do...$$
186$a$Karen$I came for an appointment the other day, but the secretary said you were 'too busy'. I don't care about your situation, I want more hair salons!$...I'll see what I can do.$$$I don't think that is a priorit at this time.$$187

192$$Judge Jeremy$How about: its illegal to park cars upside down.$You would have to try really hard to break that law... but I approve..$$193$No. I always flip my car after parking it.$$192
193$$Judge Jeremy$I'm pretty proud of this one: Thou shalt not kill!$Thats.. the 5th commandment. Make it a law, if it isnt already.$$194$No. Murder is necessary to eliminate my political opponents$$194
194$$Judge Jeremy$Okay, this is the last one: it is illegal to feed bacon to pigs.$I'm sure no one does that.$$$Thanks for the idea. I would never have thought of that.$$
195$a$Karen$UNBELIEVABLE! The pizzeria refused to accept my coupons even though they expired only 3 weeks ago! Close down that shop!$I'll see what I can do...$$$I'm pretty sure this time its your fault.$$196
